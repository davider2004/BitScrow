									<h1>WHAT IS<br />
									BITSCROW</h1>
									<p>Hi user, I think you be scammed a lot of times or you want your Bitcoin Transactions beeing safe.<br />
									That's what the escrow do. An <b>escrow service</b> works like this: first the user deposit to the escrow, <br />
									then the seller ship/give the item and then you select if release or not the money to the seller.<br />
									<b>BUT THAT IS THE PROBLEM!</b>. A LOT OF SELLERS REFUSE USING AN ESCROW BECAUSE THE USER CAN SCAM THE SELLER, <br />
									So we developed a new fantastic way to stop this: the user and the seller have timeouts of 48 hours to release (in case of the buyer) <br />
									or give the product (in the case of the seller), in the case of the seller, the transaction will be blocked and the money gived back to the buyer,<br />
									or if the buyer exceed the timeout, the money will be automatically released to the seller. Then, if the buyer give a NO RELEASE question, <br />
									instead of other Escrows we MANUALLY CHECK if the product is working or not. THIS IS A WAY TO BE SAFE DURING TRANSACTIONS. But now here are the informations:</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p><b>1. LOW FEES</b></p>
								<p>No real escrow services are free, all require some fees, but sometimes they are <b>TOO HIGH</b>, like some escrow requires the 50% OF THE PRICE OF THE TRANSACTION.</p>
								<p>But we are DIFFERENT, our fees are only of <b>0.0004 BTC / transaction</b> (+ additional 0.00001 BTC / product check; + mining fees of 0.00002 BTC). THIS IS A VERY LOW PRICE.</p>
								<p>You can also choose <b>WHO PAY THE FEES OR DIVIDE THIS FOR THE TWO PEOPLE</b>. Then for user that have done more thank <b>10 SUCCESSFULL TRANSACTIONS</b> they have to pay <b>ONLY -0.5% / transaction and NO MINING FEES</b>!</p>
								<p></p>
								<p><b>2. THE SAFETY</b></p>
								<p>Sometimes escrows have difficult to check products because they haven't access to seller-buyer communications. <b>SO WE CREATE A FREE LIVE CHAT IN OUR WEBSITE FOR COMMUNICATION BUYER-SELLER AND THE SELLER NEEDS TO UPLOAD THE SHIPPING TRACKING OR THE FILES ON OUR WEBSITE! SO YOU ARE SAFE!</b></p>
								<p></p>
								<p><b>3. NO HUMAN INTERVENTION REQUIRED FOR NORMAL TRANSACTIONS</b></p>
								<p>If the transaction doesn't have problems (like buyer says: "product not working", etc.) <b>NO HUMAN INTERVENTION REQUIRED</b>, so the transaction became faster!</p>
								<p></p>
								<p><b>4. NO PAYMENT LIMITS</b></p>
								<p>Some escrow makes limits like minimum transaction is 0.001 BTC and maximum is 1 BTC, but <b>WE DO NOT HAVE LIMITS</b>, so you can pay ANY amount of money by staying safe.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p><b>5. NO-SCAM ESCROW / WE ARE OPENSOURCE!</b></p>
								<p>On the web there are a lot of escrow, but some of them only steal your money. WE DON'T BECAUSE OUR SOURCE CODE IS OPEN-SOURCE. So you can see our <b>SOURCE CODE ON GITHUB</b> by using the link you find the footer or on the menu!</p>
								<p>We also use a verified CRYPTOPAY.ME wallet with high-speed apis and servers.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p><b>SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?</b></p>
